hi there -- i'm Tuong and here is my project of house price prediction

The project contains scrapping data from https://batdongsan.vn/ban-nha-ho-chi-minh/ and we mainly focus on house price in ho chi minh city
then we base on the data, we select only what we think important features: ['Diện tích (m2)', 'Số tầng', 'Phòng ngủ', 'Phòng WC', 'Quận, Huyện', 'Giá bán (tỷ)'] , then do data preprocessing job such as handling missing values, outlier, graph the data.
Then data featuring and apply it to train model.
